mov eax, [ebx+4*ecx] ; This line assumes that ecx is a valid index within the array pointed to by ebx.  If ecx is too large or negative, it can lead to accessing memory outside the bounds of the array, causing a segmentation fault or other unpredictable behavior.  A similar issue could happen with other addressing modes that involve scaled index registers.
